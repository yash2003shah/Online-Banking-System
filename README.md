# Online-Banking-System
This project focuses on building a comprehensive database model for an online banking system and connecting it to the C++ programming language.By producing the necessary table as indicated in the ER diagram, I have demonstrated my skill using DBS at this milestone.My database model's properties are mirrored in a total of 9 tables that we constructed.I used the C++ programming language and Oracle to build a simple HR application.

For connecting our application with the Oracle SQL database I used the Oracle C++ Call Interface (OCCI) API which provides C++ applications access to data in an Oracle database. OCCI provides a library of standard database access and retrieval functions in the form of a dynamic run-time library (OCCI classes) that can be linked in a C++ application at run time
